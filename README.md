# [RPG BattleBoard](http://battleboard.brendan.to/)

Quickly set up and play out your RPG battles quickly using the timeline and canvas. No more messy whiteboard and sticky notes! 

[Go here to try it out.](http://battleboard.brendan.to/)

### **Issues:** 
- [ ] Touch phone: touch twice to enter name - something to do with the "clear data" function. Possible fix: add extra focus function to handle touch
- [ ] Touch phone: when selecting and dragging canvas elements, it scrolls the screen as well. Possible fix: figure out how to disable scrolling when clicking and dragging on the elements if possible, otherwise will need to figure out a way to mitigate the behaviour. 
- [ ] All devices: when resizing a window / rotating screen, draggable elements go off the canvas. Possible fix: the elements need to be bumped into the canvas by the container right bound, or make the canvas stay that large until moving the elements in.
